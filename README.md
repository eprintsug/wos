# Web of Science citation plugin (WoS REST API based)

## Description
This plug-in retrieves citation data from the WoS Starter API.
It is called by the Queensland University of Technology Citation Count 
Dataset and Import plug-ins for EPrints 3.

It replaces the deprecated WoS citation plug-ins that are based on the WoS
LAMR and WoS SOAP based interfaces.

Code is currently being tested and will be published soon.
